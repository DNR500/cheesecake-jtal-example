# cheesecake-jtal-example

This example has been put together to demonstrate how to use [cheesecake](http://fmtvp.github.com/tal/) and [jTal](http://fmtvp.github.com/tal/) in association with the [Tal](http://fmtvp.github.com/tal/) framework. At the moment its a very simple implementation of jTAL but additional examples will be included in future.

To get started once you have cloned the repo..

```
cd cheesecake-jtal-example
npm install
bower install
grunt copy:setup
node index.js
```

You should then be able to open the project in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:1337/
